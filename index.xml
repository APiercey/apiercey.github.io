RygelDB is a NoSQL document store using commands to store and query documents.
Why? A colleague once said to me, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s learn Rust and build a NoSql Database! It&amp;rsquo;s easy!&amp;quot;
Through group learning sessions, we did learn Rust but we never did build that database. Unfortunately, the precious time we had was consumed by other responsibilities, and after some years, we no longer have delight of working together.</description></item><item><title>Zardoz</title><link>/projects/zardoz/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/zardoz/</guid><description>ZARDOZ A Golang testing framework for testing asyncronous dependencies.

After succesfully pitching the idea of, &amp;ldquo;Building a platform that learns as you interact with it and provides gamified content in any given content-based system&amp;rdquo;, at the Quality and Usability Lab of the Technical Universtity of Berlin, we began development of the system with a brilliant group of students.</description></item><item><title>Runner-Up of Standalone Project - Applied Research Day 13.0</title><link>/articles/applied-research-day-13-0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/articles/applied-research-day-13-0/</guid><description>It was my pleaseure to be apart of Runner-Up team accepting the Award of Excellence for Applied Research Day 12.1 for a Stand-Alone Project.
