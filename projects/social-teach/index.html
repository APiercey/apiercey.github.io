<h2 id=proving-gamification-as-a-service>Proving Gamification as a Service</h2>
<p>During my time at Passion.io, we wanted to prove we <em>Gamification as a Service</em> was firstly possible, and secondaly scalable.</p>
<p>If succesful, there was a desire to integrate such a tool into our own product line. From this, SocialTeach was born and registered as a subsidiary, where I was required to lead the technical vision of the system.</p>
<p>After succesfully pitching the idea of, <em>&ldquo;Building a platform that learns as you interact with it and provides gamified content in any given content-based system&rdquo;</em>, at the <a href=https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/qu/>Quality and Usability Lab</a> of the <a href=https://www.tu.berlin/en/>Technical Universtity of Berlin</a>, we began development of the system with a brilliant group of students.</p>
<h2 id=development--testing>Development & Testing</h2>
<p>Development ran for a single semester, which counted towards the 2016 Summer Semester. Afterwords, we had a functioning result which needed to be publicly tested.</p>
<p>We were able to run an Open-Door test on site at the TU Berlin. There, the general public was able enter, interact with the system for a single test run while results were recorded and subsequently reviewed.</p>
<h2 id=outcome>Outcome</h2>
<p>The project had been a success for both the QULab and SocialTeach. The student group was able to prove the original hypothesis and build the start of a scalable system.</p>
<p>An Open-Source copy can be found on the official QULab Github Organization: <a href=https://github.com/QULab/socialteach>https://github.com/QULab/socialteach</a></p>
<p><em>I would like to thank the entire Student Group for their excellent work. It was a great learning expierence for myself and was proud of the outcome!</em></p>
<p><em>It is necessary to express additional gratatide towards <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-wachs-dev/>Sarah Wachs</a> in particular for her contribution. Without her, the project would not have been a success! Cheers :)!</em></p>
