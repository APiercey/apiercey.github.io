## Meetup Presentation @ Solarisbank for Elixir Meetup #63

For [Elixir Meetup #63](https://eventil.com/events/63-talk-and-socialize/) I presented how fault-tolarent can be built using Commanded + Flow, showcasing how they can be used together. We had a great turn out [with Solarisbank hosting](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/solarisbank_more-than-30-elixir-enthusiasts-joined-us-activity-6580427896689606656-Yx-8/).

My team mate, Gui, had a great lightning talk describing the Elixir tool [Boundary](https://github.com/sasa1977/boundary) and it's importance in building business-first applications.
