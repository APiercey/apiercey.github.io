## Proving Gamification as a Service
During my time at Passion.io, we wanted to prove we _Gamification as a Service_ was firstly possible, and secondaly scalable.

If succesful, there was a desire to integrate such a tool into our own product line. From this, SocialTeach was born and registered as a subsidiary, where I was required to lead the technical vision of the system. 

After succesfully pitching the idea of, _"Building a platform that learns as you interact with it and provides gamified content in any given content-based system"_, at the [Quality and Usability Lab](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/qu/) of the [Technical Universtity of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/), we began development of the system with a brilliant group of students.

## Development & Testing
Development ran for a single semester, which counted towards the 2016 Summer Semester. Afterwords, we had a functioning result which needed to be publicly tested.

We were able to run an Open-Door test on site at the TU Berlin. There, the general public was able enter, interact with the system for a single test run while results were recorded and subsequently reviewed.

## Outcome
The project had been a success for both the QULab and SocialTeach. The student group was able to prove the original hypothesis and build the start of a scalable system.

_I would like to thank the entire Student Group for their excellent work. It was a great learning expierence for myself and was proud of the outcome!_

_It is necessary to express additional gratatide towards [Sarah Wachs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-wachs-dev/) in particular for her contribution. Without her, the project would not have been a success! Cheers :)!_
