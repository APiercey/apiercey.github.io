I&amp;rsquo;ll update this blog article once I find the time. A colleague once said to me, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s learn Rust and build a NoSql Database! It&amp;rsquo;s easy!&amp;quot;
Through group learning sessions, we did learn Rust but we never did build that database. Unfortunately, the precious time we had was consumed by other responsibilities, and after some years, we no longer have delight of working together.</description></item></channel></rss>
